Flask Project Auto-Generator (Batch Script)  

This batch script automatically creates a complete, ready-to-run Flask project with just one input from you: the project name.  
No manual setup. No wasted time. 
Just run the script and start building. 

What the Script Does : 
Asks you for a project name  
Creates the full Flask project folder in `F:\<your_project_name>` * 
Builds the following structure:    

project_name/
├── app.py                      

├── requirements.txt          

├── venv/                      

├── templates/

│   └── index.html            

└── static/ 
    ├── css/index.css         
    └── js/index.js           

Note : You'd have to install python in the system itself, and IDE (Vscode, Pycharm, etc)
