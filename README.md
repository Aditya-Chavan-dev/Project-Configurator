Flask Project Auto-Generator (Batch Script)  

This batch script automatically creates a complete, ready-to-run Flask project with just one input from you: the project name.  
No manual setup. No wasted time. 
Just run the script and start building. 

What the Script Does : 
Asks you for a project name  
Creates the full Flask project folder in `F:\<your_project_name>` * 
Builds the following structure:    

project_name/
├── app.py                      # Flask boilerplate with routing

├── requirements.txt           # Auto-generated after installing Flask

├── venv/                      # Virtual environment with Flask installed

├── templates/

│   └── index.html             # Basic HTML linked with CSS/JS via url_for

└── static/
    
    ├── css/index.css          # Empty CSS file

    └── js/index.js            # Empty JS file

Note : You'd have to install python in the system itself, and IDE (Vscode, Pycharm, etc)
